Work Diary

Week 1
Grouped formed. I was assigned to be the scrum master. We've decided to use Teams as the main platform for communication. I made Jira and Teams group. We decided to have userstories ready by next meeting.

Week 2
Quoc-An joined our team. Everyone had done their userstories, and we've decided to base mostly from Kristian's userstories proposal. Kristian and I finalised userstories and all were uploaded to Jira. Next meeting we will decide on user story points and aim to get proposal drafts done.

Week 3
Most of Front-end flowchart was completed by Jack and Quoc-An. We've decided on userstory points. I will be adding screenshots of Jira back-logs and we will be assigning first set of tasks for the first sprint.
