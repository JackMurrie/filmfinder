Week 1:
Was still looking for a group. Tried joining with Zechun in Hong Kong, and Alan's group in another lab, but there weren't enough people and our group was disbanded.

Week 2:
Was able to join a group in another lab w15A-lol_i_dunno. Paperwork still in progress. At our lab meeting, me and Jack were assigned to work in developing the Front-end together, while Hikari, Kristian, and Hai will work on the back-end components.  

I started development of the storyboards and interface designs for the UI and Flow Diagram component of the report. I've done the basic interfaces for the site home, account creation and login, and forgot password sections. I'm continuing to work on the interface for the core functionality of the Film Finder, i.e. personalised recommendations and watchlist tracking, which I've decided to encapsulate in a 'user dashboard' page. This work will probably continue into the next week, as I try to finish the wireframes in time for our Sunday Week 3 deadline submission of the Project Proposal.

I also started coding some drafts of the site home page with plain old HTML, CSS before we really dig into the front-end frameworks like React. Also did some basic stuff like setting up plug-ins like emmet and visual studio code while I'm working in Windows.

Week 3:
The paperwork has come through for my transfer to the W15A lab. This week was
mainly working on the project proposal, finishing the UI designs for the website
and the novelty features, and writing associated report stuff.

Week 4 (1st Sprint):
This week was effectively a no-op for me, Jack did some great work implementing
the UI and front-end in preparation for our Week 5 demo. 

Week 5 (2nd Sprint):
We presented our project demo at the beginning of this sprint. For this sprint,
I was working on integrating the front-end and back-end. I had to fix up a few
dependency issues to get the backend to build in the correct Java environment.
Jack did some great work building on his UI implementation from week 4 to flesh
out a few details of the design. 

I also worked with Hai to flesh out some of the API endpoints that we need for
backend and front-end for everything to work. Spent a lot of time figuring out
how the backend works to aid in integrating everything. Kept running into issues
with Cross Origin Request permissions (CORS), took a long time to debug that.

Final thing before the end of this sprint, I worked with Jack and Hikari to
put the finishing touches on the login and signup functionality, link it
completely with the backend.
